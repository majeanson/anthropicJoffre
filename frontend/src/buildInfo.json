    "commitMessage": "fix: Restrict team swap to teammates only\n\nFixed two issues with position swapping in team selection:\n\nIssue 1: Swap button showed for all players (cross-team swaps allowed)\n- Frontend: Swap button now only shows for players on same team\n- Team 1 players: swap button only if currentPlayer.teamId === 1\n- Team 2 players: swap button only if currentPlayer.teamId === 2\n\nIssue 2: Backend didn't validate team membership during swap\n- Added validation in validatePositionSwap() function\n- Now checks: initiator.teamId !== target.teamId\n- Returns error: \"Can only swap positions with teammates\"\n\nWhy this matters:\n- Prevents confusion from cross-team position swaps\n- Ensures logical game setup (teammates swap within team)\n- Fixes reported bug: \"can't add bots after swapping teams\"\n  (was caused by swapping with opponent team players)\n\nChanges:\n- frontend/src/components/TeamSelection.tsx: Team-specific swap visibility\n- backend/src/game/validation.ts: Added team membership check\n\nResult: Swap button only appears for your teammates, and backend\nenforces this rule with proper error messages.\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>",
