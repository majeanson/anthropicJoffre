    "commitMessage": "fix: Player stats tracking + Bot management UX + Enhanced game replay\n\nFixed critical bugs and enhanced replay functionality.\n\nCRITICAL BUG FIXES:\n1. Player Stats Tracking (Red/Brown Zeros, Trumps, Card Play Times)\n   - All stats were using socket.id instead of player names\n   - Socket IDs are volatile (change on reconnect)\n   - Caused all special card tracking to return 0\n   - Fixed: Use player names consistently throughout stats tracking\n   - Affected: roundStats initialization, card play tracking, stat retrieval\n\n2. Bot Management Modal Flickering\n   - Missing stopPropagation on content div\n   - Added onClick={onClose} to overlay\n   - Added onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()} to content\n\n3. Bot Management Display Cleanup\n   - Removed unnecessary rules info box\n   - Removed points and trick points display\n   - Simplified to show only name, team, and bot status\n\nGAME REPLAY ENHANCEMENTS:\n1. Trick-by-Trick Navigation\n   - Previous/Next trick buttons\n   - Jump to specific trick with timeline selector\n   - Current trick highlighted with yellow border\n\n2. Auto-Playback System\n   - Play/Pause button\n   - Speed controls: 0.5x, 1x, 2x\n   - Auto-advances through tricks and rounds\n   - Pauses at end of game\n\n3. Timeline View\n   - Visual trick selector (T1, T2, T3, T4)\n   - Color-coded: yellow (current), blue (played), gray (upcoming)\n   - Click any trick to jump directly\n\n4. Player Stats Integration\n   - New \"Game History\" tab in PlayerStatsModal\n   - Shows last 20 games with win/loss status\n   - Displays team, score, tricks, points, bet info\n   - \"View Replay\" button for finished games\n\nFiles Changed:\n- backend/src/index.ts: Fixed stat tracking to use player names\n- frontend/src/components/GameReplay.tsx: Added playback controls\n- frontend/src/components/PlayerStatsModal.tsx: Added history tab\n- frontend/src/components/BotManagementPanel.tsx: Fixed flickering, cleaned UI\n- CLAUDE.md: Already documented player name principle\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>",
