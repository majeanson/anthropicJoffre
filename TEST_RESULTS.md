## Failed Tests Analysis

### 1. Card Count Not Decreasing After Playing
**Test:** `Card Playing Phase › should decrease card count after playing`

**Issue:** After a player plays a card, the card count remains 8 instead of decreasing to 7.

**Expected:** 7 cards
**Received:** 8 cards

**Root Cause:** The frontend is not properly removing the played card from the player's hand in the UI, or the backend is not updating the game state correctly.

**Files to Check:**
- `backend/src/index.ts` - Socket handler for `play_card`
- `frontend/src/components/PlayingPhase.tsx` - Card display logic

---

### 2. Scoring Phase Not Showing
**Tests:**
- `should complete a full round and show scoring phase`
- `should award points when bet is met`
- `should deduct points when bet is not met`
- `should double points for "without trump" bets`
- `should start new round after scoring`

**Issue:** After completing all 8 tricks, the game is not transitioning to the scoring phase. The text "Round X Complete" or "round.*complete" is not visible.

**Expected:** Game should show scoring phase with team scores
**Actual:** Stuck in playing phase or not showing expected text

**Root Cause:** The backend is not emitting `round_ended` event with proper game state, or the frontend is not rendering the scoring phase correctly.

**Files to Check:**
- `backend/src/index.ts` - `endRound()` function around line 200+
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Scoring phase rendering (line 169-203)

---

### 3. Trick Winner Not Tracked
**Test:** `should display trick winner correctly`

**Issue:** After playing a complete trick, the UI is not showing which player won the trick. The text "tricks.*1" is not visible.

**Expected:** One player should show "Tricks: 1" or similar
**Actual:** No player shows trick count

**Root Cause:** The `resolveTrick()` function may not be properly updating `player.tricksWon`, or the frontend is not displaying it.

**Files to Check:**
- `backend/src/index.ts` - `resolveTrick()` function
- `backend/src/game/logic.ts` - `determineWinner()` function
- `frontend/src/components/PlayingPhase.tsx` - Player info display

---

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Card Removal from Hand
This is a fundamental game mechanic issue that affects all gameplay.

**Action:**
1. Check `play_card` socket handler in backend
2. Verify card is removed from `player.hand`
3. Verify frontend updates hand display on `game_updated` event

### Priority 2: Fix Scoring Phase Transition
This blocks all scoring-related tests.

**Action:**
1. Review `endRound()` function - ensure it emits `round_ended`
2. Check if game phase is set to 'scoring' after 8 tricks
3. Verify frontend listens to `round_ended` event

### Priority 3: Fix Trick Winner Tracking
Important for game progression and player feedback.

**Action:**
1. Review `resolveTrick()` function
2. Ensure `player.tricksWon` is incremented for the winner
3. Test `determineWinner()` logic with various card combinations

### Priority 4: Game Rules Adjustment
After fixing the failing tests, review and adjust game rules as needed based on test insights.
