## Why Archive?

These documents were creating a "to-do loop" where completed work appeared as pending work. By archiving:
1. Clear separation between done and todo
2. Easier to focus on next priorities
3. Historical record preserved for reference
4. Reduced documentation clutter

*To restore any archived document, simply move it back to its original location.*
